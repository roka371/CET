				The Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology (CET) is an academic center within UC Berkeley College of Engineering. Established in 2005, CET's mission has been to equip engineers and scientists with the skills to innovate, productize, and commercialize technology in the global economy. A strategic initiative under the Fung Institute for Engineering Leadership, CET teaches the latest topics in entrepreneurship and innovation through educational programs, research, and strong industry participation, promoting internationally recognized methodologies such as the Lean Startup Process and the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurial Education. Recognizing UC Berkeley's unique role as the flagship public university and its charter to promote model citizenship, CET explicitly instills an ethos of "Pay It Forward" among its students, faculty, and alumni, ensuring that all participants of the program become active mentors to the next generation of student entrepreneurs. CET supports the development of startups through partnerships with incubators in industry and the Berkeley Skydeck.
